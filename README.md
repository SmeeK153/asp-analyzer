# Introduction 
The simple act of including files in ASP can cause performance issues even if that code is never actually executed. This project helps to highlight all of the code that is included, and possibly double included within your ASP project.

# Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.	Installation process
2.	Software dependencies
3.	Latest releases
4.	API references

# Random Stuff
When trying to find and replace to remove include statements here is a good regex: `<!--\s+#include\s+file\s*=\s*"([^"]+)"\s+-->\s*\n`

# Build and Test
TODO: Describe and show how to build your code and run the tests.
